TODO:

- CSS fixes -> if I can fix that I can fix it - if not - no big deal
- may need to seperate out the useEffect calls to the useApplicationData.jsx 

BUG:
- Topic list bug --> associated with the API server - great..
- DESIGN ISSUE --> missing persisting of the favourite state - will need to 
add another table to sort that one out. 
- CSS bugs
